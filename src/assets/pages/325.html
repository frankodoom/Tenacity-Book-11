Thula carried Lindiwe on </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a4e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">his back and half-swam, half-dragged her along; it was very difficult for him. He saw a black object ahead, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a4f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">lying on the surface of the water. Thinking it was a log he dived towards it but clinging on, he found to his </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a50 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">horror that it was scaly. It swung sharply, flipping a powerful tail which splashed water into the couple’s eyes. </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a51 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">There was pandemonium. Lindiwe fell off Thula’s back as the crocodile advanced towards them. Thula dived </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a52 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">under water for some seconds.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3a53 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he surfaced for air he found himself no more than a metre from the crocodile. Simultaneously the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a54 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">reptile charged and Thula dived again. Under water, he struck at the crocodile’s soft belly and the reptile, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a55 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">incensed, dived to attack him. Then, catching Thula’s foot in its jaws as it passed, it snapped off three of his </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a56 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">toes and Thula surfacing cried out loudly in pain. However, when he saw that the crocodile had turned to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a57 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">attack him for a third time, Thula dived under he water and the crocodile missed him.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3a58 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the struggle, Thula had forgotten about Lindiwe. He swam furiously to avoid the crocodile until he </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a59 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">caught sight of the girl. She was clinging to a boulder downstream. With horror he realised that the crocodile, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a5a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in search of easier prey, was bearing down on her.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y3a5b ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Extract 2</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a5c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Thula lunged towards Lindiwe shouting at the top of his voice to warn her. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3a5d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lindiwe stood, confused and cried loudly. Despite the agonising pain in his foot as the rough waters </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a5e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">washed over the new wound, Thula knew he must save Lindiwe. He dived under the water and swam towards </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a5f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">her. The crocodile swam, keeping only its eyes and nostrils above the water. Thula pushed Lindiwe and she </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a60 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">fell into the water. With the crocodile in pursuit once more Thula ducked underwater, playing for time, but </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a61 fff3 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">when <span class="fff0">he rose, gasping for air, the crocodile was waiting to charge, jaws wide open.
