The answer to this question is not easy, but in </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364a ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">general employers seem to look for a number of qualities in job-applicants.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364b ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>In the first place, employers like would-be employees to know their own minds. They </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364c ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">like applicants to be decisive - to have a clear idea of what they want to do in life, as well as </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364d ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">realistic notions of what is involved in achieving their goals. Thus applicants who are career-</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364e ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fcb sc0">conscious definitely stand a better chance than those who ar</span><span class="fcb sc0">e indecisive. </span></div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364f ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>Clearly, applicants can only show this quality if they have done some homework </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3650 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">before the interview, to find out something about the organization they are applying to join, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3651 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and to understand the kinds of opportunity that might open up. They should also find out </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3652 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">if possible about the history, aims and problems of the organisation; its products, if any; its </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3653 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">training programmes; and the long-term job prospects. Showing evidence of your interest in the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3654 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">organisation will impress the interviewer.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3655 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>However, this does not mean that the applicant should try to appear a “know-all” at the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3656 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">interview. Far from it! While employers expect certain minimum academic achievements in their </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3657 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be employees, they are far more interested in whether the applicant is ready, willing and </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3658 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">able to learn, often from  fellow-workers who may, on paper, be far less well-qualified. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3659 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>This last point is crucial. A new employee must have respect for those already employed </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365a ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the organisation, even if the latter are less-qualified. There are plenty of older employees </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365b ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">around who when young did not have the same educational opportunities as the present </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365c ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">generation. There can be no future for those new employees who look down on any of their </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365d ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">colleagues or senior officers on these grounds. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365e ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>On the other hand, employers do like their young workers to be reasonably ambitious. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365f ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Organisations depend a great deal for their growth and prosperity on the willingness of their </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3660 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">younger employees to improve themselves, and a spirit of friendly competition is usually highly </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3661 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">desirable, provided it is carried on in a reasonable way.        </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3662 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>However, ambition is not the same thing as greed. Many young people when they </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3663 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">first get a job think that the world is at their feet. In their desire to impress their friends and </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3664 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">relatives, they often bite off more than they can chew in terms of financial obligations. It is </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3665 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">easier to apply for a car or motorcycle loan than to make sure you have enough money left </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3666 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">every month to pay off your debt. Employers lay great stress on new employees having a realistic </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3667 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">judgment of their income, so that they can budget properly in their personal affairs.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3668 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>One last point is worth mentioning: it pays to dress conventionally and smartly. It would </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3669 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">be foolish to throw away your chance of a job, or of promotion once in the job, merely because </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y366a ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of your clothes.</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y14 ffe5 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">M12_ENG_SB_ETHG11_0285_M12.indd   301<span class="_ _e5"> </span>28/3/11   11:42:09 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
