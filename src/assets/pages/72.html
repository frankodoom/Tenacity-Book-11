The cost </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc7b ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of living is much higher with expensive market prices, </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc7c ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">bus fares and the high cost of buying or renting accommodation. In addition, the city is dirty: </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc7d ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">there are often piles of refuse on street corners and we can never be sure that our water is </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc7e ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">clean. Perhaps the worst thing about the city is the noise and the crowds; Sometimes you can’t </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc7f ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk down the street, there are so many people and then there are police sirens, cars hooting, </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc80 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">street vendors shouting. All of these can be very stressful and mean that it is difficult for people </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc81 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to relax.</div><div class="t m0 x58 h1d yc82 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the other hand there are very good reasons why people come to the city.

The </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc85 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">countryside doesn’t offer nearly the same opportunities for young ambitious people. One final </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc86 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">point is that life is never dull in the city: there are cinemas, shops, cafés, stadiums and many </div><div class="t m0 x8 h1d yc87 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">other things to entertain us and where we can make new friends.
