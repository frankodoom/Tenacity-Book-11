Her English parents were there on a tour of Europe. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 ycff ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 958.81px;">However, she grew up and spent most of her life in England. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd00 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 937.81px;">She was an intelligent girl and felt that God had called her to do </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd01 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 916.803px;">important work. She was interested in nursing but at the time it was not considered </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd02 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 895.798px;">a suitable job for a young woman from a good family. Her parents wanted her </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd03 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 874.794px;">to marry well and be a conventional wife and mother. However, Nightingale was </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd04 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 853.789px;">determined and in 1851 her parents allowed her to start work as a nurse in a </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd05 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 832.785px;">hospital. In 1854, Britain and France went to war with Russia in the Crimea, in </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd06 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 811.78px;">the Black Sea. There were soon reports of the lack of medical care for wounded </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd07 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 790.776px;">soldiers. A few months later, Nightingale set out for the Black Sea with a team of </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd08 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 769.771px;">nurses.

She was </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd0e ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 635.247px;">awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII, shortly before her death, in 1910.</div><div class="t m0 x15 h19 yd0f ff37 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 472.741px;">TEXT C</div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd10 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 443.239px;">Christiaan Barnard is an important figure in medical history as he </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd11 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 422.234px;">performed the first heart transplant operation in the world in 1967, </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd12 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 401.23px;">a time when heart surgery in general was rare.</div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd13 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 371.728px;">He was born in South Africa in 1922 and trained as a surgeon in Cape </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd14 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 350.723px;">Town. After doing some further training in heart surgery at a hospital </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd15 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 329.719px;">in the USA, when he returned to Cape Town, he became a leading </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd16 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 308.714px;">heart surgeon. In December 1967 he transplanted the heart of a road </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd17 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 287.71px;">accident victim into a 59 year old man suffering from heart failure. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd18 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 266.705px;">As a result of this operation, Barnard became an overnight celebrity. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd19 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 237.203px;">Unfortunately, Barnard’s patient died 18 days later of pneumonia, as the drugs he was taking </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1a ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 216.199px;">to stop his body rejecting his heart, weakened his body. Another of Barnard’s patients lived for </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1b ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 195.194px;">over a year and a half after surgery. However, infection was a major problem: patients needed </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1c ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 174.19px;">drugs to prevent the body rejecting the donor heart, but these left them open to infection and </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1d ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 153.185px;">many died. Consequently, heart transplantation did not become widespread until a Norwegian </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1e ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 132.181px;">researcher, HP Frey, discovered the drug Cyclosporin in 1974, which prevented the body </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1f ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 111.176px;">rejecting the new organ and at the same time, protected against infection. Barnard continued </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd20 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 90.172px;">performing heart transplants until 1985 and many of his patients survived for many years after </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd21 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 69.167px;">the operation. He was forced to retire when arthritis in his hands meant he could no longer </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd22 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 48.163px;">perform surgery.</div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd23 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 18.661px;">Barnard continued to lecture and advise on heart surgery until his death in 2001.</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y14 ff3d fs8 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -139px;">M03_ENG_SB_ETHG11_0285_M03.indd   69<span class="_ _53"> </span>28/3/11   11:21:06 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div><audio controls="" src="assets/audio/SB11 U3 A3.10 P6801_41__03_14.mp3" style="position: absolute; height: 54px; top: 116px;"></audio><audio controls="" src="assets/audio/SB11 U3 A3.10 P6803_18__04_59.mp3" style="position: absolute; height: 54px; top: 732px;"></audio></div>
