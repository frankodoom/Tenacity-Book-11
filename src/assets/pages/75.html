Her English parents were there on a tour of Europe. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 ycff ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, she grew up and spent most of her life in England. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd00 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">She was an intelligent girl and felt that God had called her to do </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd01 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">important work. She was interested in nursing but at the time it was not considered </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd02 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">a suitable job for a young woman from a good family. Her parents wanted her </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd03 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to marry well and be a conventional wife and mother. However, Nightingale was </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd04 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">determined and in 1851 her parents allowed her to start work as a nurse in a </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd05 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">hospital. In 1854, Britain and France went to war with Russia in the Crimea, in </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd06 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Black Sea. There were soon reports of the lack of medical care for wounded </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd07 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldiers. A few months later, Nightingale set out for the Black Sea with a team of </div><div class="t m0 x15 h48 yd08 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">nurses.

After doing some further training in heart surgery at a hospital </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd15 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the USA, when he returned to Cape Town, he became a leading </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd16 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart surgeon. In December 1967 he transplanted the heart of a road </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd17 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident victim into a 59 year old man suffering from heart failure. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd18 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a result of this operation, Barnard became an overnight celebrity. </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd19 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unfortunately, Barnard’s patient died 18 days later of pneumonia, as the drugs he was taking </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1a ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to stop his body rejecting his heart, weakened his body. Another of Barnard’s patients lived for </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1b ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">over a year and a half after surgery. However, infection was a major problem: patients needed </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1c ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">drugs to prevent the body rejecting the donor heart, but these left them open to infection and </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1d ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">many died. Consequently, heart transplantation did not become widespread until a Norwegian </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1e ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">researcher, HP Frey, discovered the drug Cyclosporin in 1974, which prevented the body </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd1f ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">rejecting the new organ and at the same time, protected against infection. Barnard continued </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd20 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">performing heart transplants until 1985 and many of his patients survived for many years after </div><div class="t m0 x15 h1d yd21 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the operation.
