It’s because our capital city is where the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y396f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">headquarters of the African Union, or the AU as it is usually called, are situated. But the AU plays an </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3970 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">important role in the lives of Africans everywhere.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3971 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">How did the AU start? Well, as you may know it began as the OAU, the Organisation of African Unity. In </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3972 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the early 1960s most African nations, except Ethiopia, were newly independent after centuries of European </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3973 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">colonisation. These new nations faced many difficulties.  Inspired by Kwame Nkrumah, the prime minister of </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3974 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ghana, the OAU was launched in 1963 here in Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa, hosted by Emperor Haile Selassie. The </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3975 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">aims of the OAU were to promote cooperation among its 32 member nations. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3976 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">By the 1990s many Africans felt that the organisation should do more work on issues of common interest </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3977 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">throughout the continent. So Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi put forward the idea of a more integrated </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3978 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">African Union, which in 2002 was launched officially at a summit in Durban, South Africa. It is made up of 53 </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3979 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">independent African nations.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y397a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The African Union is not just one organisation. It is made up of several political and administrative bodies, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y397b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">or organs, concerned with good governance and, human rights as well as social and economic affairs. I will </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y397c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">now describe seven of them.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y397d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Assembly is the highest body of the AU and is made up of all the heads of state of the member </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y397e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">nations. They meet at regular summits in cities in different parts of Africa. The voice of the people of Africa is </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y397f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">heard at the Pan-African Parliament, the PAP, situated in South Africa. The members of this Parliament are </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3980 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">elected by the parliaments of the member states. The AU Commission, situated in Addis Ababa, carries out the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3981 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">day to day running of the AU.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3982 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Other than these three, there are many other bodies which already carry out the work of the AU in </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3983 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">different areas. ECOSOCC is concerned with social and cultural affairs, NEPAD is responsible for furthering the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3984 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">development of Africa by Africans. A very important body is the Peace and Security Council which sends AU </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3985 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">troops to keep the peace in conflict areas. They have already been engaged in Burundi, in Darfur in Sudan, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3986 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and in Somalia. Other important bodies are still being developed: Africa’s own financial institutions, including </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3987 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">a central bank, a court of human rights to protect the rights of individuals and a court of justice.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3988 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The AU faces many problems: there are sometimes disputes between member states. For example Morocco </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3989 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">is not a member as it refuses to recognise another member, Western Sahara, as an independent nation.  </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y398a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Another major problem is lack of money to allow all the bodies of the AU to do their work as effectively as </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y398b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">they should. Nonetheless, the AU has already shown that it is the voice of Africa and is listened to not only in </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y398c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Africa, but around the world. We Africans are proud that we can work together as brothers and sisters to make </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y398d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">our continent a better place for all its citizens.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y398e ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A2.4</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y398f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Education in Ethiopia has a very long history.
