He said he thought the carburettor </div><div class="t m0 x8 h4e y1d0a ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">was playing the fool. </div><div class="t m0 x55 h4e y1d0b ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Next morning Bhakcu got up early and was at it again. We had planned to leave at eight, but </div><div class="t m0 x8 h4e y1d0c ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">at ten to, Bhakcu was still tinkering.

The gateway was wide, big enough for a </div><div class="t m0 x8 h4e y1d15 ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">car, and the jar, about four inches wide, was in the middle.

American women, wearing haughty sun-glasses, raised their voices whenever they </div><div class="t m0 x8 h4e y1d26 ff88 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">spoke.
