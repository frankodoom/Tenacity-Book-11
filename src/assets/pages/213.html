The young men threw their sickles into the air and caught </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25be ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">them as they fell. They shouted and danced as they followed the tom-tom players.  My </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25bf ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">grandmother had warned me not to be too friendly with these players. But it would </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c0 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">have been impossible for me to tear myself away from their spirited music, from their </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c1 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">sickles flashing in the rising sun and the sweetness of the air.</div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c2 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">   When they reached the first field the men lined up naked to the loins with their </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c3 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">sickles ready. My uncle Lansana or some other farmer – for the harvest threw people </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c4 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">together and everyone helped everyone else – signalled that the work was to begin.  </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c5 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Immediately, the black torsos would bend over the great golden field, and the sickles </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25c6 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">begin to cut.

They had to cut off the stalk near the last joint and the last leaf at the same </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25ca ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">time that they stripped the leaf.  They almost never missed. This was largely due to the </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25cb ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">way the reaper held the stalks so as to cut them.  Each man made it a point of honour </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25cc ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to reap as regularly and rapidly as possible.  As he moved across the field he had a </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25cd ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">bundle of stalks in his hand.  The other men judged him by the number and size of </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25ce ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">these bundles.</div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25cf ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">   My young uncle was wonderful at rice cutting, the very best.

I tore off the leaves, </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25d1 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">trimmed the stalks and piled them.  Since rice is always harvested when it is very ripe, </div><div class="t m0 x52 h52 y25d2 ffad fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and if handled roughly, the grains drop off, I had to be very careful.
