In addition we are working on long-term programmes to establish centres around the country for </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e4c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the treatment and prevention of conditions such as TB, kala azar, HIV/Aids, malaria and meningitis. In some </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e4d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">places these centres have been handed over to the government and our work is done.

However, yesterday I was </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a98 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">here at my post. I woke up at the normal time, which is 5 o’clock and made a cup of tea and then spent </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a99 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the next hour catching up on email from my family and friends in the USA. I was in the office by 7.00, and </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">my assistant Habtu was already there. His daughter Saba had come in with him as she wanted to look for </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">something on the Internet. By 8.00 I was out of the office and on the road. The village I was going to wasn’t </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">far away, about 10 km but because of the state of the road it takes about an hour to get there. I spent the rest </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b3d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the morning inspecting a well and a small scale irrigation project which the community is building. I’ve </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b3e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">been coming here regularly for the past few months. The villagers have done all the work themselves. I just </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b3f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">take look at what they’ve done, take measurements and make suggestions. It’s looking good though and it </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b40 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">should help the village to extend their growing season. Anyway, I got back to the office about 1o’clock. Lunch </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b41 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">time! So I went home and I had a nap for about an hour, then went back to work. In the afternoon I started </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b42 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">my quarterly report for the Ministry. Writing reports is the worst part of the job for me!  But luckily just as </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b43 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was trying to find the documents I needed I was interrupted! This happens a lot and it means that I often </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b44 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">have to catch up with my work in the evenings at home. Yesterday, one of the most important community </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b45 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">leaders in the area came in to see me and so I stopped and made coffee for him. He drops in from time to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b46 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">time to talk about water projects and everything else!  But I enjoy our conversations and it’s an important part </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b47 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the job. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b48 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left the office about 5.30 and after a quick shower and change of clothes I went straight out to a party </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b49 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">given by an aid worker who lives nearby. I knew everyone there and it was great to listen to music, talk, have </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b4a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">a drink and some food.  I didn’t get home and go to bed until midnight, which is too late for a weeknight. And </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b4b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">here I am again today! </div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y3b4c ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A12.3</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b4d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Perhaps the greatest human achievement in the 20</div><div class="t m0 x123 h8b y3b4e fff0 fs41 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">th</div><div class="t m0 x72 h1d y3b4f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> century was the beginning of space exploration.  It </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b50 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">began after the Second World War as a competition:  the Space Race between the USA  and the Soviet Union, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b51 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">or Russia. The Russians won the first two victories. They sent the first man-made craft into space with the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b52 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">successful launch of Sputnik in 1957, a radio satellite which spent 3 months orbiting the Earth. Then in 1969  </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b53 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Russians put the first man in space with the launch of Vostok 1 manned by Yuri Gagarin</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b54 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In 1969 the USA scored a great victory over the Russians when Neil Armstrong became the first man to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b55 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission. The Russians to this day have not put a man on the moon. </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b56 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Apollo moon missions continued until 1974.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b57 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">During the 1970s the Americans also constructed a laboratory in space.

It was replaced by the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b5c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">International Space Station which is expected to remain in operation until 2015. This is truly international, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b5d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">with scientists from several different countries working there for long periods of months, even years at a time. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b5e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the mid 1970s the Americans began to develop the Space Shuttle.
