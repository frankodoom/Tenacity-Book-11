In 1895, while working at the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h48 yd2f ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">University of Würzburg, in Germany, he was studying what </div><div class="t m0 x10 h48 yd30 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">happened when an electric current was passed through a </div><div class="t m0 x10 h48 yd31 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">gas of extremely low pressure and also on the properties of </div><div class="t m0 x10 h48 yd32 ff42 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">cathode rays.
