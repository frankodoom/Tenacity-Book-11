It was difficult to tell which was the first and last born among the </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y84b ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 339.304px;">children of the second wife. Nonetheless, Oweka was very proud of them. They were sent to </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y84c ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 318.3px;">school, but only the three boys. Oweka refused to send his three girls to school. It was not </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y84d ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 297.295px;">their privilege to learn. Their work was to learn how to dig, cook and later on get married. </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y84e ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 276.291px;">Maria’s mother, unlike the second wife, would not listen to Oweka. She wanted her daughter </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y84f ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 255.286px;">to go to school. She knew her position well. Maria was her only child and if she was to lead a </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y850 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 234.282px;">poor life then she had no other child to look to as a source of comfort. She was very poor but </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y851 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 213.277px;">she scratched everywhere to get money to send her daughter to school. She made a contract </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y852 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 192.273px;">with a shopkeeper in the nearby trading centre. She sold him firewood at a <a onclick="showDictionary('meagre'); return false;">meagre</a> price </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y853 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 171.268px;">and thus had to carry firewood for six months in order to pay the school <a onclick="showDictionary('fees'); return false;">fees</a> for one term. In </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y854 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 150.264px;">a year she was able to pay for only two terms. The shopkeeper, however, realised her good </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y855 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 129.259px;">intentions and agreed to lend her money. Every morning she got up, went to her garden and </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y856 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 108.255px;">after digging she would come back, make breakfast, eat and carry firewood to the shopkeeper. </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y857 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 87.25px;">In the afternoons, she went to the bush to collect firewood for the next day. In the evening she </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y858 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 66.246px;">would go to her garden. She always slept exhausted. Oweka did not like this at all. Maria was </div><div class="t m0 x55 h1d y859 ff29 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 45.241px;">failing to learn the ways of the kitchen and she might in future fail to get married.
