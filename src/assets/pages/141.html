However I belive that most accidents occur when students arrive </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y193f ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the morning and again when they leave at the end of the day. My first suggestion is </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1940 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefor that we have a crossing patrol on duty for an hour at both of those times. Their </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1941 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">responsibility would be to stopping the traffic every few minutes to allow students to </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1942 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">cross the road. They could operate in a point in front of the school where all students </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1943 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">would have to cross. There could be penalties for students who donâ€™t cross in this point.</div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1944 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _7e"> </span>Another suggestion would be for road signs to put up on either side of the school </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1945 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">warning drivers of the crossing patrol and tell them to slow down. This could be made </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1946 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">more effective if a police officer was present in front of the school in the morning and in </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1947 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the afternoon to warn drivers and to make sure they slow down.</div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1948 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _7e"> </span>Finally I think we have a road safety campaigne in the school. Perhaps a police officer </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1949 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">or someone else could come and give usefull advices to students about road safety. </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y194a ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">There could also be a road safety poster and essay competitions to make students think </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y194b ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">about this issue.</div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y194c ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _7e"> </span>The present situation is serious and I believe that with these mesures we could go </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y194d ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">some way redusing the number of accidents in front of the school.  </div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y194e ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Yours sincerly</div><div class="t m0 xbe h64 y194f ff75 fs2b fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Legamo Tolore</div><div class="t m0 xbe h63 y1950 ff74 fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Legamo Tolore</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y14 ff67 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">M05_ENG_SB_ETHG11_0285_M05.indd   135<span class="_ _e5"> </span>28/3/11   11:24:20 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
