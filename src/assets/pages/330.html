The governments of most rich countries try to help poor countries to do so. Multinational institutions </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1e48 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">like the World Bank also provide money and projects to improve the lives of poor people. Many other NGOs </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1e49 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and charitable groups around the world work to do the same. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y1e4a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">As we look forward, development, by its nature, will always be ongoing, even when these goals are met. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1e4b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">People will always try to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of their children.

When his parents were out, Lebna </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b17 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">had responsibility for his brother Kihele, who was still only a baby. So this is what happened one day. Lebna </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b18 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">had promised his mother he would sweep the yard while she was out. Before going outside to do this, Lebna </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b19 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">lay Kihele on his bed to sleep, and then he put a pot of food on the stove for his lunch. As he swept he was </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">looking forward to eating something. What he didn’t know was the wind was blowing strongly and the curtain </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">at the window was billowing dangerously close to the fire under the pot of food. Lebna didn’t see the curtain </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">catch fire and the first he knew about it was when he looked up and was horrified to see flames and smoke </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">coming through the window.  He acted swiftly. Dropping the broom he grabbed a blanket which was hanging </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the washing line. Then, he found a can of water and poured it over the blanket. Putting the wet blanket </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b1f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">over his head he rushed into the house , which was now blazing inside. The blanket gave him the protection </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b20 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">he needed to go over to his sleeping brother, pick him up and rush him outside. As he made his way out of </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b21 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the door, the neighbours were already rushing to the scene, amazed at what Lebna had been able to do.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b22 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A11.2</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b23 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Question 1: You work for an international NGO. Can you tell me which one that is?</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b24 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">I work for Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF as it is usually called.  In America it is called Doctors Without </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b25 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Borders. I work in their London office.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b26 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Question 2: What exactly does MSF do?</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b27 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">MSF works in two kinds of situation. Firstly, in emergencies, such as an earthquake or a war, MSF provides </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b28 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">essential healthcare and runs hospitals and clinics, performs surgery, tackles epidemics, carries out </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b29 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">vaccination campaigns, operates feeding centres for malnourished children and offers psychological support. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b2a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">We can also dig wells or dispense clean drinking water and distribute materials like blankets, plastic sheeting </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b2b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and other basic necessities. Secondly we have longer-term programmes, in which we treat patients with </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b2c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">diseases such as TB and HIV / AIDS. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b2d ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Question 3: On what principles is MSF based?</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b2e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well, MSF is committed to independent humanitarian action guided by medical ethics and the principles </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b2f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of neutrality and impartiality. This means that MSF offers assistance to people based only on need and </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b30 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">irrespective of race, religion, gender and with no links to any political belief or party. MSF does not take sides </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b31 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in armed conflicts</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b32 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Question 4: Where does MSF work?</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b33 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">MSF is a worldwide movement with offices in 19 countries and an international coordination office in Geneva, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b34 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Switzerland. It also has field offices in 65 countries where it has medical projects.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b35 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="ffee">Question 5: What kind of people do you employ? </span></div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b36 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Currently 25,000 people are engaged by MSF as health professionals, which means doctors and nurses, then </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b37 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">there are water and sanitation experts, logistics experts who plan the movement of supplies and staff to where </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b38 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are needed, and in addition there are administrative staff, running our projects in approximately 65 </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b39 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">countries around the world. This staff is made up of foreign experts and locally hired staff.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3b3a ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Question 6: How did MDF start?</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b3b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was set up in 1971 by a group of French doctors. In the early days it was just a group of medical doctors </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3b3c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">who travelled to different parts of the world providing medical aid.
