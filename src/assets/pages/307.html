The answer to this question is not easy, but in </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364a ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 497.873px;">general employers seem to look for a number of qualities in job-applicants.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364b ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 472.628px;"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>In the first place, employers like would-be employees to know their own minds. They </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364c ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 451.624px;">like applicants to be decisive - to have a clear idea of what they want to do in life, as well as </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y364d ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 430.619px;">realistic notions of what is involved in achieving their goals.

They should also find out </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3652 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 321.356px;">if possible about the history, aims and problems of the organisation; its products, if any; its </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3653 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 300.352px;">training programmes; and the long-term job prospects.

Far from it! While employers expect certain minimum academic achievements in their </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3657 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 212.093px;">would be employees, they are far more interested in whether the applicant is ready, willing and </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3658 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 191.089px;">able to learn, often from  fellow-workers who may, on paper, be far less well-qualified. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3659 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 165.844px;"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>This last point is crucial. A new employee must have respect for those already employed </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365a ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 144.839px;">in the organisation, even if the latter are less-qualified. There are plenty of older employees </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365b ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 123.835px;">around who when young did not have the same educational opportunities as the present </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y365c ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 102.83px;">generation.

It is </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3665 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -94.691px;">easier to apply for a car or motorcycle loan than to make sure you have enough money left </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3666 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -115.696px;">every month to pay off your debt. Employers lay great stress on new employees having a realistic </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3667 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -136.7px;">judgment of their income, so that they can budget properly in their personal affairs.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y3668 ffe1 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -161.945px;"> <span class="_ _4c"> </span>One last point is worth mentioning: it pays to dress conventionally and smartly.
