When I was a child there was no school for me. One of my brothers went to </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39bd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">primary school; it was run by the church. In those days girls were married at the age of seven or eight. School </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39be fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">was considered unsuitable for girls, firstly because they had to get married and also because they had to work </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39bf fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">at home. But also because bad things can happen to girls when they are outside the house, away from their </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">families And we had to work hard! I used to grind the grain, fetch water and do housework without being </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">told. I knew what my parents expected of me and I did it.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y39c2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was married aged nine, but my life was unchanged: I was working from early morning till night.

My son died though, when he was only two years old and I </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">was unable to have any more children. My husband sent my daughter to primary school for a few years, but </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">we needed her to help us at home, so when she was 11 we kept her at home. We faced many difficulties and </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">my daughter was not married until she was 16. Then she had three girls, my granddaughters! They seem to </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">know everything! One is at primary school and two of them are now at secondary school. I’m not in favour of </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39c8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">that. Boys lie in wait for the girls in the bushes by the road when they walk home. I’ve seen them do it.

A few years of primary school </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39cb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">is important. Children need to know reading and writing in the modern world. But they must learn how to </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y39cc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">look after the house. My daughter says her girls will get good jobs and earn money.
