In many countries tourism </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17c9 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">plays an important part in the national economy. For example in Kenya, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17ca ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">tourism is the most important sector in the economy, contributing about </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17cb ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">20 per cent to its total GDP. In Ethiopia, too, with its unique combination of </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17cc ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">natural beauty and historic and cultural attractions, tourism is increasing and it </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17cd ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">is anticipated that its contribution to the economy will grow.</div><div class="t m0 x4f h60 y17ce ff6f fs5 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Advantages</div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17cf ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Foreign tourists in particular bring with them much needed foreign currency </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17d0 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">which can be invested in improving local education, health and other services. </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17d1 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Wealth is created at a local level, too, as employment opportunities are </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17d2 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">available in tourist centres. These include jobs in construction: building hotels, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17d3 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">roads and other facilities, which may only be short-term, but also careers in </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17d4 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the tourist trade itself, such as in hotels, restaurants, tour companies.

For example, many of the </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17db ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">benefits do not stay in the country where the tourism takes place. Profits </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17dc ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">may go to foreign companies, such as multinational hotel chains and tour </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17dd ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">operators. Foreign workers may be brought in to do skilled jobs, while only low </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17de ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">paid low-skilled jobs are offered to local people. Regional funds may be spent </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17df ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">on infrastructure projects to promote tourism, rather than on schools and </div><div class="t m0 x4f h1a y17e0 ff6e fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">hospitals needed by local people.
