      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10f7 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 904.586px;">At the end of the third year I took the examinations for
        a certificate of proficiency. We were </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10f8 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 883.581px;">told that a minimum of sixty per cent was required to
        pass the tests in technical and classical </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10f9 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 862.577px;">subjects and that the Conakry engineers were to be our
        examiners. Then the school designated </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10fa ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 841.572px;">the fourteen most likely candidates. Fortunately my name
        was among them. I was determined </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10fb ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 820.568px;">to pass. I had worked hard for three years. I had never
        forgotten my promise to my father, nor </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10fc ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 799.563px;">the one I had made to myself. I had always been among the
        three highest students and hoped </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10fd ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 778.559px;">to maintain my rating. But I wrote to my mother to see
        the marabouts and get their help. Was </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10fe ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 757.554px;">I especially superstitious at that time? I do not think
        so. I simply believed that nothing could </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y10ff ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 736.55px;">be obtained without God’s help, and that, even if His
        will were predetermined, our actions, </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1100 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 715.545px;">though these too were predetermined, influenced it. And I
        felt that the marabouts were my </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1101 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 694.541px;">natural intermediaries. </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1102 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 660.782px;">My aunts offered up sacrifices and presented kola nuts to
        the various persons the marabouts </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1103 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 639.777px;">indicated they had consulted. I could see they were very
        anxious about me. I believe they were </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1104 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 618.773px;">as anxious as my mother. Maria was even more so, if
        possible. She didn’t set much store by </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1105 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 597.768px;">her own studies, but she would have been deeply
        distressed not to see my name in the list of </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1106 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 576.764px;">successful candidates in the official newspaper of French
        Guinea. My aunt told me that Maria </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1107 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 555.759px;">also had been to the marabouts, and I really think that
        touched me more than anything else.</div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1108 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 522px;">Finally the examination came. It lasted three days. Three
        days of agony. But the marabouts </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1109 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 500.996px;">must have given me all the help they could. Of the seven
        candidates who passed I was first.</div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110a ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 467.237px;">When I returned to Kouroussa with my proficiency
        certificate in my pocket and feeling, I </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110b ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 446.232px;">must confess, a little swollen with my success, I was
        greeted with open arms, with the same </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110c ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 425.228px;">eagerness and affection that had awaited me at the end of
        every school year. This time I had </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110d ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 404.223px;">a fresh sense of pride. On the road from the station to
        our concession there had been the </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110e ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 383.219px;">most enthusiastic demonstrations of welcome, and they had
        all sprung from the same love </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y110f ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 362.214px;">and friendship. But while my parents embraced me, my
        mother was probably rejoicing more </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1110 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 341.21px;">over my return than over the diploma – my mind was
        uneasy, especially so far as she was </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1111 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 320.205px;">concerned.</div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1112 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 286.446px;">Before I had left Conakry the director of the school had
        sent for me and asked me if I would </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1113 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 265.442px;">like to go to France to finish my studies. I had blithely
        answered yes, but I had said it without </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1114 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 244.437px;">having consulted my parents, without having consulted my
        mother. My uncles in Conakry had </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1115 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 223.433px;">told me that it was a unique opportunity and that I
        didn’t deserve to live if I turned it down. </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1116 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 202.428px;">What would my parents say? Especially my mother? I did
        not feel at all comfortable. I waited </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1117 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 181.424px;">until the first ecstatic greetings were over and then
        announced loudly, as if the news would be </div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1118 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 160.419px;">a source of delight to everyone.</div>
      <div class="t m0 x5c h1d y1119 ff39 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 126.66px;">“And that’s not all: the director wants to send me to
