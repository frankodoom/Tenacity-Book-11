Some have their disability from birth but the majority occur later on in life, either through </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ac8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">illnesses such as meningitis or as a result of injury caused by accidents, armed conflicts or landmines.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ac9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">2 <span class="_ _8c"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>After centuries of discrimination and prejudice, disabled people are now demanding their rights to live in </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3aca fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">society alongside the able-bodied. One of the most basic rights is access to buildings. For example, few of </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3acb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the able bodied realise how many steps there are to climb just to get through the doors of many schools, </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3acc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">hospitals, railways stations and offices. For someone who can barely walk, or who is in a wheelchair, these </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3acd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">make access very difficult or even impossible. Moreover, once inside a building, there may be several </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ace fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">flights of stairs to negotiate. Fortunately wheelchair ramps and lifts are more commonplace making it </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3acf fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">possible for large numbers of disabled people to go about their daily lives independently.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ad0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">3 <span class="_ _8c"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>Access to education and employment has also been a major focus of the disability rights movement. Both </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">schools and workplaces have often been reluctant to admit the disabled, believing that they would be </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">unable to cope with school or work life. Yet it is often the case that once simple access issues are dealt </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">with, the disabled are proving time and again that there are no limits to the heights they can reach. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ad4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">4 <span class="_ _8c"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>Another important right the disabled are now exercising concerns independent living. In the past they </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">relied or less totally on their able-bodied relatives, but now many disabled people are playing an active </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">part in society on their own, or with far less support than was once necessary.  They are able to do </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">this thanks to a variety of disability aids. Some of these, such as walking sticks, wheelchairs, spectacles </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and hearing aids have existed for a long time. In the modern age there are technological aids such as </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ad9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">computers with Braille keyboards speech controlled computers, speaking clocks, and many other gadgets. </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ada fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">These enhance quality of life and allow the disabled to be financially independent.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3adb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">5 <span class="_ _8c"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>One of the most difficult rights to achieve is acceptance by the able-bodied community. The disabled are </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3adc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">considered inferior, and are often wrongly assumed to suffer mental impairment. As a result, many doors </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3add fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">remain closed. Assumptions are made by the able-bodied that disabled people can’t cope with work or </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ade fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">activities that in fact are well within their capabilities. Then too, the disabled face being stared at in the </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3adf fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">street, being called names and even bullied, sometimes by their own families, on a daily basis.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">6 <span class="_ _8c"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>Much progress has been made with disability rights. In most countries of the world the disabled have won </div><div class="t m0 x60 h1d y3ae1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls13 ws0">many legal rights. There has also been to some extent a change in attitudes. But the battle is far from won.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3ae2 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">B9.3</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3ae3 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Milliam, Uganda</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">As a result of childhood polio, Milliam is paralysed in both legs. Nonetheless, succeeded in completing a </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">BA in fashion design and business management.  Her hard work seemed to be in vain, however, when on </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">graduating she could not get a job. No employers were interested in employing a disabled person. The </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">outlook was not good until she heard about an NGO working for people with physical disabililty. Through </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">this organisation she met other disabled people. They helped her  not only to find out about her legal rights, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3ae9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">but  also to understand that believing in yourself, and not letting others undermine your self-esteem is an </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3aea fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">important part of achieving your dreams. She realized that this had been lacking in her previous attempts </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3aeb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to find work. With her new-found confidence, she found a good job in a medical foundation and after a few </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3aec fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">years there, she went on to work as an instructor in a technical skills college, a job she loves.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3aed ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel, England</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3aee fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Rachel suffers form dwarfism.
