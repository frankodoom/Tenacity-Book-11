Rising temperatures and changes in seasonal rainfall patterns have already </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a66 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">had significant impacts on the world.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a67 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The increase in global temperatures has led to the melting of ice at the North and South Poles poles. If </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a68 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">polar ice continues to melt then sea levels will rise. In fact <span class="_ _7"></span>they are projected to rise by 15 to 95 centimetres by </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a69 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">2100. This may lead to the disappearance of  low-lying coastal areas around the world. In addition, mountain </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a6a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">glaciers are threatened by rising temperatures. A case in point is Africa’s highest mountain, Kilimanjaro in East </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a6b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Africa. An estimated 82 per cent of the icecap that 100 years ago crowned the peak, is now gone. This impacts </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a6c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">on humans as the snow and ice on this ice cap feeds into several rivers which are now drying out in the warm </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a6d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">season. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a6e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In parts of the northern hemisphere one effect of global warming is heavier rainfall. Meanwhile in Africa </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a6f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Asia it is causing severe droughts. In fact Incidence of drought has already increased from 1 to 3 per cent </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a70 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the globe in the last 50 years. By 2050 it is likely to increase to 12 per cent .</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a71 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Climate change threatens species of animals and plants that are adapted to live in certain conditions.  </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a72 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">When this happens their first response is to migrate to areas where the conditions they need exist. As a result, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a73 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">many species of plants and animals previously found only in tropical regions are now found in areas that </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a74 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">were previously too cool.  However, in crowded regions, such as East Africa, there is nowhere for plants and </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a75 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">animals to migrate to as there are too many people and forests have been cut down for agriculture. There is a </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a76 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">real threat that species will become extinct as their natural habitats are lost and there is nowhere for them to </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a77 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">migrate to. An example of this is the mountains eastern central and southern Africa where species diversity, is </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a78 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">threatened by rising temperatures and deforestation and extinction is likely for many isolated such as the wild </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a79 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Arabica coffee plant in southern Ethiopia as there is nowhere for it to go.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a7a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since most agriculture in Africa relies on seasonal rains, it is put at risk by changes in climate variability, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a7b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">seasonal shifts, and precipitation patterns. Any amount of warming will result in increased water stress. It is </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a7c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">predicted that disruption to agriculture will mean that by 2050 up to 30 million more people in the world will </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a7d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">be hungry Many will be forced to leave their homes and migrate to other areas or countries. This along with </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a7e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">lack of water in some regions of the world may lead to economic and political problems and possibly even </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a7f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">wars. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a80 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Climate change will have significant impacts on biodiversity and food security in Africa. Consequently </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a81 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">substantial reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions in developed countries and careful adaptation to </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a82 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">changes in climate are crucial.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h19 y3a83 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A7.5</div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a84 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Life on Earth depends on heat. The normal average temperature of our planet is 15° C. In fact, many places, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a85 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">for example in Africa, are much warmer than this, and other places, such as the continent of Antartica, are </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a86 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">much colder. Heat comes from the Sun which passes through the Earth’s atmosphere to its surface. However, </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a87 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">some of the heat is radiated back out into the atmosphere.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a88 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Earth’s atmosphere is made up of different gases: 99 per cent is nitrogen and oxygen whereas the </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a89 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">other 1 per cent consists of other gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, water vapour and </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a8a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">halocarbons. They are called greenhouse gases as they act in the same way as the glass walls and roof of a </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a8b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">greenhouse which trap heat so that vegetables can be grown in places where outside temperatures are too </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a8c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">cold.  </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y3a8d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Greenhouse gases keep the Earth’s warm temperature as they absorb heat and stop it escaping back out </div><div class="t m0 x2f h1d y3a8e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">into Space.
