Of course, many people who can’t afford to go to a hospital or buy medicines they come to me as they </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39da fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">have no choice. You see I can help everyone: I don’t turn people away if they are poor; I just ask them to pay </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39db fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">me what they can.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y39dc ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A3.4</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39dd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">TB is an abbreviation for tuberculosis. It has been a killer disease for thousands of years. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39de fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The disease is contagious, caused by bacteria which are spread by coughing and sneezing, just like the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39df fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">common cold. It is diagnosed by means of a test. It affects the lungs and can also spread to other parts of </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the body. An infected person may or may not be ill with the disease. If your body is strong and healthy you </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">may be able to fight it off. Those who do develop it suffer from a bad cough, tiredness and loss of appetite.  </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, the disease, it is not necessarily a death sentence, as long as you are treated. If not treated, each </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">person with active TB can infect on average 10 to 15 people a year.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39e4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The best way to prevent TB is vaccination. This should be given to babies. Also, testing facilities have to be </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">available so that people can get tested if they have been in contact with someone with TB.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39e6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The introduction of antibiotics in the middle of the 20</div><div class="t m0 x1a1 h8b y39e7 fff0 fs41 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">th</div><div class="t m0 x83 h1d y39e8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> century decreased the number of deaths from TB </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39e9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">dramatically.  However, since the 1980s the numbers have been going up again sharply. The World Health </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39ea fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Organisation says that TB kills more young people and adults than any other infectious disease. There are </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39eb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">more than nine million cases a year world-wide and two million die from it. In Africa alone there are two </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39ec fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">million cases a year. The disease is so common now largely because of HIV / AIDS. One third of HIV positive </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39ed fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">victims develop TB as their bodies’ immune systems are too weak to fight it. Another factor is that the disease </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39ee fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">is becoming drug-resistant. One important reason for this is that many people stop their treatment. This </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39ef fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">encourages the bacteria which carry the disease to become tougher. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39f0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The treatment is long and hard. It takes six months and many people suffer from side effects. Ideally </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">sufferers need someone who lives near them to support them by helping them and making sure they take </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">their medicine. The treatment must not be stopped, even when patients start to feel better. Some people also </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">go to traditional healers for help with the symptoms and the side effects of the drugs. This can be useful, but </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">it should not replace medical treatment.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39f5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">So there are some important things to remember about TB: if you have been in contact with someone who </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">has TB get tested, and if the test is positive, get treated. Finally, when you start the treatment, carry on with it </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the end.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y39f8 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A4.2</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39f9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">HIV is a virus and viruses in the body are difficult to kill. When it enters the body it destroys the immune </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39fa fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">system which protects our bodies against disease. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39fb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The virus is transmitted or passed from person to person in one of four body fluids: blood, semen, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39fc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">vaginal fluid and breast milk.  It has to get inside the body and into the bloodstream. It is not transmitted </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39fd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">through vomit, urine, saliva, faeces or pus. There is no evidence to show that the virus can be transmitted by </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y39fe fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">mosquitoes. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y39ff fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The virus is usually transmitted during sex, when the delicate skin in the genital area is cut. This causes </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a00 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">bleeding that you may or may not be able to see. It can also be transmitted when blood from a cut of an </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a01 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">infected person, enters a wound of an uninfected person.  So, if you are treating a wound on another person, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a02 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">if you don’t know their HIV status, you should use plastic gloves or put each of your hands inside a plastic bag. </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a03 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The virus cannot be caught in swimming pools as it cannot survive in water. Neither can it be transmitted by </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a04 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">touch. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3a05 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Having sex outside marriage is risky. You cannot be sure that someone is HIV negative unless they have </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a06 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">had a test. Even someone who has never had sex may be HIV positive because they may have picked up the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a07 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">virus in some other way.   </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3a08 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y14 fff5 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG11_0285_Z01.indd   317<span class="_ _16c"> </span>28/3/11   11:43:07 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
