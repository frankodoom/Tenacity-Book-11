There are a number of factors. Firstly, security. In spite of </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d20 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">being at the frontline of the Cold War between the communist East and capitalist West, South </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d21 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Korea has done its best to maintain peaceful relations with its neighbours, North Korea, </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d22 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">China and Japan, with the protection of the USA. In addition it has had strong, efficient </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d23 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">governments. Leaders have come and gone, but they have all been focussed on economic </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d24 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">growth. Most notably President Pak Chung Hee, who led the country in the 1960s and 70s, </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d25 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and was determined to make it self-reliant. Under his leadership everyone’s living standards </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d26 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">improved, not just those of the elite.</div><div class="t m0 xbe h1d y2d27 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">4 <span class="_ _1b"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>During Pak’s presidency, the slogan ‘export or die’ summed up the country’s economic </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d28 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">approach. Imports were kept to a minimum, and were largely made up of raw materials </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d29 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">which where then manufactured into finished products such as electronics, textiles, ships, </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d2a ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">automobiles, and steel. These were then exported. In more recent years the country has </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d2b ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">embraced technology and is now at the forefront of innovation in computing and cell </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d2c ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">phones.

Also </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d31 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">important is the fact that the government has reversed the brain drain by encouraging </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d32 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">overseas-trained scientists to go back home.</div><div class="t m0 xbe h1d y2d33 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m0 xbe h1d y2d34 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">6 <span class="_ _1b"> </span> <span class="_ _51"></span>The Miracle on the Han River has been due to a combination of good governance and </div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y2d35 ffc4 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hard work of the Korean people themselves.
