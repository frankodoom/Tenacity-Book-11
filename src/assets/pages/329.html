Her supervisors stood over her, watching everything she did, unconvinced that she could </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e94 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">do the necessary work and often not believing results they saw with their own eyes. Many times Rachel had </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e95 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to question unfavourable grades until her assessors were forced to admit that in fact she had managed to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e96 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">perform duties they didn’t think she was capable of.

In </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1eb9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">his 20s, while working at Cambridge University, he developed motor neuron disease, a condition in which </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1eba fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">gradually all muscles cease to function. At a time when he was already confined to a wheelchair, unable to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ebb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">walk or use his arms, his speech began to slur until it became incomprehensible. For a time, the only way he </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ebc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">could communicate was to spell out words letter by letter, by raising his eyebrows when someone pointed to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ebd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the right letter on a spelling card. However, a colleague developed for him a computer program which allows </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ebe fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">him to speak by selecting words from a computer screen, using head or eye movements. When the message </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ebf fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">is complete it goes through a speech synthesizer and comes out as perfectly comprehensible speech. The </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ec0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">computer and synthesizer are attached to his wheelchair. Using this device, Professor Hawking has written </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ec1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">books and scientific papers, given lectures and made speeches. Although not exactly the same as the speech </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ec2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of a normal human, it is a good substitute. The only problem for Professor Hawking, is, he says, that it gives </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1ec3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">him an American accent!</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y3af4 ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">B10.2</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3af5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In a world that is very rich, many people are very poor. Development is about reaching these people and </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3af6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">helping them improve their lives. I am going to consider what development does and doesn’t mean and what </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3af7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">its aims are.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3af8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">What then is a developed country? It is not a simple question to answer, It is easier to say which countries </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3af9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">are richer and which are poorer. But indicators of wealth, which reflect the quantity of resources, provide </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3afa fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">no information about the allocation of those resources – for instance, whether or not they are distributed </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3afb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">equally and used to provide free health and education services. Nor do indicators of wealth tell us about the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3afc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">effects of production and consumption on people’s environment. Thus it is no wonder that countries with </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3afd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">similar average incomes can differ substantially when it comes to people’s quality of life, that is, their access </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3afe fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to education and health care, employment opportunities, availability of clean air and safe drinking water, the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aff fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">threat of crime, and so on. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b00 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Like wealth indicators, economic growth is often used to measure a country’s development. It is true </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b01 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">that economic growth by increasing a nation’s total wealth, also enhances its potential for reducing poverty </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b02 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and solving other social problems. But history offers a number of examples where economic growth was </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b03 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">not followed by similar progress in human development. Instead growth was achieved at the cost of greater </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b04 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">inequality, higher unemployment, weakened democracy, loss of cultural identity, or overconsumption of </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b05 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">resources needed by future generations. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b06 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">What then is purpose of development if it is not to merely increase national wealth?  Recent United </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b07 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nations documents emphasise “human development,” measured by life expectancy, adult literacy, access </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b08 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">to all three levels of education, as well as people’s average income which is a necessary condition of </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b09 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">their freedom of choice. In a broader sense the notion of human development incorporates all aspects </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b0a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of individuals’ well-being, from their health status to their economic and political freedom. According to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b0b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Human Development Report 1996, published by the United Nations Development Program, “human </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b0c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">development is the end – economic growth a means”. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b0d fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">In 2000 most of the countries of the world, under the auspices of the United Nations, established a list </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b0e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">of goals called the Millennium Development Goals or MDGs. These are eight targets that will help meet the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b0f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">basic development needs of most people. They are: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, improve maternal </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b10 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">health, achieve universal primary education, combat HIV / AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, promote gender </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b11 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">equality and empower women, ensure environmental sustainability, reduce child mortality, develop a global </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b12 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">partnership for development </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3b13 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">That brings us onto consider who are the agents of development. Development is a cooperative effort of </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3b14 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">many.  First of all the poor themselves, who struggle daily to provide for themselves and their families.
