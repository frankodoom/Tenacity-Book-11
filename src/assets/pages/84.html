Diseases once thought of as a problem for the rich are now affecting the poor and </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yea5 ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">disadvantaged.

Tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and the </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yea8 ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">harmful use of alcohol are cited as the major risk factors.  Many of the diseases caused by these </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yea9 ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">factors can be prevented through changes in lifestyle. The WHO urges countries to enact measures </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yeaa ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">that make it easier for people to adopt healthy lifestyles.  Although non-communicable diseases can </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yeab ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">be managed, treated and sometimes cured, prevention is likely to bring the greatest gains, particularly </div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yeac ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in poor countries which can ill-afford the cost of long-term treatment of chronic conditions.</div><div class="t m0 x24 h12 yead ff44 fs9 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The fight against the traditional killer diseases in poor countries continues.
