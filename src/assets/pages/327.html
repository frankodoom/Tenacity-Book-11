As a result of this increase in carbon dioxide, more </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y1e4a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">and more heat is being trapped.

The seasonal rain fall activity has </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a93 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">continued across much of the country for the last few days and. For the coming three days, the current rain </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a94 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">bearing systems are going to remain across western and central parts of the country for a few days across </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a95 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">western and central parts of the country. So starting in the west. the heavy rainfall of the last few days will </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a96 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">continue in Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella, southern and western Oromia and SNNPR, with flooding in some </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a97 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">areas. Temperatures will be in the region of 27 to 33 degrees Centigrade during the day, falling to 12-15 </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a98 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">degrees at night.  In the north of the country, in Tigray Amhara and Afar, the heavy rain of the last few days </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a99 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">has eased and it will be sunny with some isolated showers. Temperatures will be in the mid 30s during the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9a fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">day 15-20 degrees at night. As the rain moves south and east, there may be some showers in Somali in a few </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9b fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">days, but for today and tonight it will be dry and sunny, though partly cloudy. Temperatures will be in the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9c fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">region of 34 degrees during the day and 15 degrees at night.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y3a9d ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A8.1</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9e fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">The sun heats water in oceans and seas which causes it to evaporate as water vapour into the air. Water </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3a9f fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">vapour is an invisible gas.  Evaporation also occurs in other ways: from water in rivers and lakes, from water </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">in ice and snow and from water in soil. In addition, water vapour is released from plants into the air through </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">the process known as transpiration. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3aa2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Water vapour is taken up into the atmosphere by rising air currents by a process known as convection, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">which causes warm air to rise. Cooler temperatures then condense the water vapour into clouds. Rising air </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">currents take the vapour up into the atmosphere where cooler temperatures cause it to condense into liquid </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">water droplets in the air, which produces clouds. Precipitation, in the form of rain or snow, occurs when cloud </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">particles collide, grow and then fall out of the sky. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3aa7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">A vital factor in the process is known as advection: this is the movement of water in the form of vapour, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aa8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">clouds or precipitation through the atmosphere. Without advection, very little rain would fall over land.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3aa9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Most rain falls back into the oceans, but also it falls onto land. It then flows over the ground as surface </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aaa fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">run-off. Some of this run-off soaks into the ground and the rest flows into rivers, which then carry it to the </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aab fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">ocean. Evaporation then takes place and the water cycle continues.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h19 y3aac ffee fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">B8.1</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aad fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Water covers three-quarters of the earth’s surface, but only a fraction of 1 per cent of it is available for human </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aae fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">use. Most of the rest is saltwater and of the remaining freshwater most is in the form of ice or is in hard to </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aaf fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">reach aquifers. Yet we humans have an absolute need for fresh water. 10 per cent or our need is for domestic </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab0 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">use which consists of water for drinking, cooking, washing and so on. We use a massive 70 per cent for </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab1 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">irrigation and the remaining 20 per cent is largely accounted for by industry.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3ab2 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Today the world is facing a water deficit and many countries are already water-stressed, which means they </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab3 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">do not have enough freshwater to meet the needs of their population. This is because we are using 45 times </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab4 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">as much water today as people did 300 years ago. </div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3ab5 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">An indicator of water shortage is rivers running dry and lakes disappearing. For example in central Africa, </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab6 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Lake Chad has shrunk by some 95 per cent over the past 40 years. This kind of event is due partly to natural </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab7 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">factors, in other words a decrease in rain and increased temperatures. However, also to blame for dried up </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3ab8 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">rivers and lakes is human activity, such as the building of dams and irrigation channels.</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3ab9 fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0"><span class="fcb sc0">Another important reason for water shortage is the increased</span><span class="fcb sc0"> use of electric and diesel pumps. When the </span></div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3aba fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">pumping of water from wells depended on human or animal power, the amount pumped was limited, but </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3abb fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">now with powerful mechanically driven pumps, aquifers can be depleted in a matter of years, more quickly </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y3abc fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">than nature can replenish them,</div><div class="t m0 x159 h1d y3abd fff0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some 80 countries, supporting 40 per cent of the world’s population, already suffer from serious water </div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y14 fff5 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG11_0285_Z01.indd   321<span class="_ _16c"> </span>28/3/11   11:43:07 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
